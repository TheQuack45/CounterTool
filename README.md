# CounterTool

This is a Xamarin-based mobile app for Android, iOS, and UWP that allows users to create independent counter items that can be incremented or decremented. For example, it can be used to keep track of the score of a football game. The maximum and minimum values and the size of the increment step can be changed for each counter.
